        Overview
        ========
        
        This is the home of the cormorant software package for learning on atomic environments.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        To install the documentation, go to the docs folder and run "make html".  You will need to install the sphinx_rtd_theme (this can be done using pip install).
        
        Getting started
        ===============
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Cloning the git repo
        `````````````````````
        
        Cormorant can be cloned directly from the git repo using::
        
            git clone https://github.com/risilab/cormorant.git
        
        Using pip
        `````````
        
        Cormorant is installable from source using pip.  You can currently install it from
        source by going to the directory with setup.py::
        
            pip install cormorant .
        
        If you would like to modify the source code directly, note that Cormorant
        can also be installed in "development mode" using the command::
        
            pip install cormorant -e .
        
        
        Training example
        ----------------
        
        The example training script is in :examples/train_cormorant.py:. The same script
        can train both the datasets QM9 and MD17, and can also be extended to more general datasets.
        ::
        
            python examples/train_qm9.py
        
        ::
        
            python examples/train_md17.py
        
        Note that if no GPU is available, the the training script will throw an error.
        To force CPU-based training, add the : --cpu: flag

        Architecture
        ================
        
        A more detailed description of the Cormorant architecture is available in `the Cormorant paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04015>`_.
