# champs_kaggle
Collection of data related to the CHAMPS kaggle competition.

The [dataset](./dataset) folder contains the training data available in the competition as well as the hidden test data.
This data is slightly different than the data used in the competition, as there was a small symmetry related error in the original dataset that only affected the supplementary data (which none of the top teams used) of a small number of molecules.
The exact validation/test splits are unknown to me, but Walter Reade from Kaggle can likely provide this information if it's needed.

The code from the top 5 teams are available at [this link](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lb17101_bristol_ac_uk/EtytPe_A1oJCluX4YUW9lSMBIZcjuMJPBArr7k3N69XwCA?e=22nocy).
