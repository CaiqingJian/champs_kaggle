# champs_kaggle
Collection of data, scripts and analysis related to the CHAMPS kaggle competition.

The [dataset](./dataset) folder contains the training data available in the competition as well as the hidden test data.
This data is slightly different than the data used in the competition, as there was a small symmetry related error in the original dataset that only affected the supplementary data (which none of the top teams used) of a small number of molecules.
The exact validation/test splits are unknown to me, but Walter Reade from Kaggle can likely provide this information if it's needed.

The [analysis](./analysis) folder contains the submitted predictions by the top 400 teams, as well as scripts to analyse this.
