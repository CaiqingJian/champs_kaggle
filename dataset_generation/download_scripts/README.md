# download_scripts
Scripts to download data files needed to run the scripts from the parent folder, as well as output from these scripts.

[download_all_data_generation.sh](../download_scripts/download_all_data_generation.sh) will execute all scripts below and will thus download all of the files to the [data](../data) folder.

Executing [download_qm9_exyz.sh](../download_scripts/download_qm9_exyz.sh) will download `qm9_exyz.tar.gz` which contains all the 130,831 extended xyz files of QM9 of molecules that passed the geometry consistency check of the original QM9 paper.

Executing [download_xyz_files.sh](../download_scripts/download_xyz_files.sh) will download `xyz_files.tar.gz` which contains all the xyz files generated by executing [convert_exyz.py](../convert_exyz.py).

Executing [download_gaussian_input_files.sh](../download_scripts/download_gaussian_input_files.sh) will download `gaussian_input_files.tar.gz` which contains all the Gaussian input files for NMR computations generated by executing [convert_exyz.py](../convert_exyz.py)

Executing [download_gaussian_output_files.sh](../download_scripts/download_gaussian_output_files.sh) will download `gaussian_output_files.tar.gz` which contains all the Gaussian output files from NMR computations.

Executing [download_kaggle_dataset.sh](../download_scripts/download_kaggle_dataset.sh) will download `kaggle_dataset.tar.gz` which contains the Kaggle dataset generated by executing [create_dataset.py](../create_dataset.py).
